"""Work out what the next Gauntlet round should be — deterministically.

Reads the run on disk (BAR.md, RUBRIC.md, PIECES.md, STATE.md, rounds/*) and
prints the next round number, which lens and piece are up, the capture command
to use, a ready-to-paste ab.py invocation, the budget standing, and whether any
stop condition has actually been met.

This exists to keep an unattended round cheap. Deriving "which lens is next"
from four files costs model tokens every round and can drift; here it is a
function of the ledger, so a firing that has just cleared its context can spend
its whole budget on the work instead of on re-orienting.

It also checks the two things a builder is worst at judging about its own run:
whether the win streak really covers a full rotation, and whether the last few
rounds have been chasing the same gap without moving it.

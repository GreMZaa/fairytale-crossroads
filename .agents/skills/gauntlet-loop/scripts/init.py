"""Create the skeleton for a Gauntlet run.

Writes the run directory with BAR.md, RUBRIC.md, PIECES.md, STATE.md and
open_gaps.md already in the shape the other scripts parse, copies the reference
into ref/, and prints what still needs a human decision.

The point is not to save a few file writes. It is that ab.py, reveal.py,
progress.py and next.py all read these files by pattern — a hand-written
RUBRIC.md whose lenses are prose instead of `- **name** — question` bullets
leaves next.py unable to rotate, and that failure shows up at 3am rather than now.

Nothing here is overwritten if it already exists, so running it twice on a live
run is safe.

Usage:
  init.py .gauntlet/<slug> --goal "..." [--bar "..."] [--ref path/to/reference.png]
          [--kind game|product|image|ui|model3d|gamefeel|video|text|spec|code]

`--kind game` and `--kind product` additionally write DELIVERABLE.md — the
definition of done for the *product*. next.py refuses to open a quality round
while any of its gates is unchecked, which is what stops a "make an AAA game"
run from spending forty rounds on a screenshot of a game.

One line per piece, in the syntax below — `facet:` first, `capture:` last, because
next.py parses the command as everything after `capture:`.

    - **<name>** — facet: play — capture: <command writing to the round's artifact path>

**A piece is a promise of rounds.** Rounds are spent per piece, so whatever is not
a piece here simply never gets worked on. This is where a "make it AAA" run quietly
turns into a screenshot run: six visual pieces means six visual rounds per rotation
and nothing ever spent on the thing being played.

So the decomposition has to cover the product, not its surface. next.py enforces the
floor: at least one `play` piece, and surface pieces (`visual` + `ux`) no more than
half the total. Facets available:

{facet_help}

Order matters — pieces are worked in the order listed and the first one takes round 1.
Put the piece the product most fails to *be* at the top; put `visual` last.

DELIVERABLE_TEMPLATE = """# Deliverable — what "done" means for this product

The definition of done, written before round 1 and ticked as it is met. **next.py
will not open a quality round while any gate here is unchecked.** That refusal is
the point of this file: a gauntlet is a polishing loop, and polishing something
that cannot yet be played end to end produces a beautiful thing that is not the
thing that was asked for.

Syntax — one gate per line, and a `check:` that says how it is verified:

    - [ ] <what must be true of the product> — check: <command, or `manual: <what to do>`>

Rules:

- Gates are **must-haves for a shippable product**, not wishes. Aim for 8–12. Every
  extra gate is a quality round that does not happen.
- A gate that genuinely cannot be met here gets `BLOCKED: <why>` in its text; next.py
  reports it and stops treating it as a blocker, so the run moves on honestly rather
  than grinding.
- Adding a gate mid-run is allowed and gets a line in STATE.md. Deleting one to
  unblock the loop is the same move as softening the rubric — don't.
- Tick a gate only when its `check:` actually passes. These are re-checked as free
  gates every round, so a regression pulls the run back off polish and onto the product.

## Gates

- [ ] The product starts from one documented command on a clean machine — check: <cmd>
- [ ] A first-time user reaches the core activity without being told how — check: manual: <what to do>
- [ ] One full session runs start → end with no dead end, softlock or empty screen — check: <cmd>
- [ ] It is possible to fail / be wrong, and the product says so — check: <cmd>
- [ ] Progress or state survives a reload — check: <cmd>
- [ ] Every action answers with feedback (sound and motion, or an explicit result) — check: <cmd>
- [ ] There is enough content that a session does not run out — check: <cmd>
- [ ] It holds its performance target for a full session — check: <cmd>
- [ ] Nothing in the shipped build is placeholder, debug, or lorem — check: <cmd>
- [ ] It runs on the target device/browser it is meant for — check: <cmd>

Replace every line above with the real gates for *this* product; the list is a
prompt, not a spec. Anything with an angle-bracket placeholder still counts as
unwritten and next.py will say so.
